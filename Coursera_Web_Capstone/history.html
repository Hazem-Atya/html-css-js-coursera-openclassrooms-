                Music is found in every known society, past and present, and is considered to be a cultural
                universal[1][2]. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form
                of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population
                prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently, the first music may have been invented
                in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life, using various different
                materials to make various instruments.[3][4]

                A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic
                organization and experience, climate, access to technology and what religion is believed. The emotions
                and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the
                attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. "Music history" is
                the distinct subfield of musicology and history which studies music (particularly Western art music)
                from a chronological perspective.

                <span style="font-size: 2em">Prehistoric music</span> <br>
                Prehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in
                preliterate cultures (prehistory), beginning somewhere in very late geological history. Prehistoric
                music is
                followed by ancient music in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced
                areas, but still exists in isolated areas.

                Prehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent
                of
                any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional Native American
                music of preliterate tribes and Australian Aboriginal music. However, it is more common to refer to the
                "prehistoric" music of non-European continents – especially that which still survives – as folk,
                indigenous
                or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some
                suggest
                that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring sounds and rhythms. Human music may echo
                these phenomena using patterns, repetition and tonality. Even today, some cultures have certain
                instances of
                their music intending to imitate natural sounds. In some instances, this feature is related to
                shamanistic
                beliefs or practice.[5][6] It may also serve entertainment (game)[7][8] or practical (luring animals in
                hunt)[7] functions.

                It is probable that the first musical instrument was the human voice itself, which can make a vast array
                of
                sounds, from singing, humming and whistling through to clicking, coughing and yawning. As for other
                musical
                instruments, in 2008 archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the Hohle Fels cave near Ulm,
                Germany.[9][10][11] Considered to be about 35,000 years old, the five-holed flute has a V-shaped
                mouthpiece
                and is made from a vulture wing bone. The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near Greystones,
                Ireland, in 2004. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50
                cm
                long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.[12]

                It has been suggested that the "Divje Babe Flute", a cave bear femur dated to be between 50,000 and
                60,000
                years old, is the world's oldest musical instrument and was produced by Neanderthals.[13][14] Claims
                that
                the femur is indeed a musical instrument are, however, contested by alternative theories including the
                suggestion that the femur may have been gnawed by carnivores to produce holes.[15]

                <span style="font-size: 2em">Ancient music</span> <br>

                "Ancient music" is the name given to the music that follows music of the prehistoric era. The "oldest
                known
                song" was written in cuneiform, dating to 3400 years ago from Ugarit in Syria. It was a part of the
                Hurrian
                songs, more specifically Hurrian hymn no. 6. It was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and was
                demonstrated to be composed in harmonies of thirds, like ancient gymel,[16] and also was written using a
                Pythagorean tuning of the diatonic scale. The oldest surviving example of a complete musical
                composition,
                including musical notation, from anywhere in the world, is the Seikilos epitaph, dated to either the 1st
                or
                the 2nd century AD.

                Double pipes, such as those used by the ancient Greeks, and ancient bagpipes, as well as a review of
                ancient
                drawings on vases and walls, etc., and ancient writings (such as in Aristotle, Problems, Book XIX.12)
                which
                described musical techniques of the time, indicate polyphony. One pipe in the aulos pairs (double
                flutes)
                likely served as a drone or "keynote," while the other played melodic passages. Instruments, such as the
                seven holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the Indus valley
                civilization archaeological sites.[17]

                Indian classical music (marga) can be found from the scriptures of the Hindu tradition, the Vedas.
                Samaveda,
                one of the four vedas, describes music at length.

                Ravanahatha (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in
                Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of
                King Ravana. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world
                history.

                The history of musical development in Iran (Persian music) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great
                legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to
                the
                days of the Elamite Empire (2500–644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's
                history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The Sassanid period
                (AD
                226–651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life
                in
                Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of
                their works have survived.

                The Early music era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including Asian music,
                Persian music, music of India, Jewish music, Greek music, Roman music, the music of Mesopotamia, the
                music
                of Egypt, and Muslim music.

                <span style="font-size: 2em">Biblical period</span> <br>


                According to Easton's Bible Dictionary, Jubal was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical
                instruments
                (Gen. 4:21). The Hebrews were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature
                afford abundant evidence of this. After the Deluge, the first mention of music is in the account of
                Laban's
                interview with Jacob (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the Red Sea, Moses and the children
                of
                Israel sang their song of deliverance (Ex. 15). But the period of Samuel, David, and Solomon was the
                golden
                age of Hebrew music, as it was of Hebrew poetry. Music was now for the first time systematically
                cultivated.
                It was an essential part of training in the schools of the prophets (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also
                a
                class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). Solomon's Temple, however, was the great school
                of
                music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were
                constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1–6). In private life also music seems to have
                held
                an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4–6; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer.
                48:33;
                Luke 15:25).[18]

                Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of Semitic and early Judeo-Christian
                culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical
                cultures
                of the Hebrews with those of the later cultures of the Greeks and Romans. The common area of performance
                is
                found in a "social phenomenon called litany," a form of prayer consisting of a series of invocations or
                supplications. The Journal of Religion and Theatre notes that among the earliest forms of litany,
                "Hebrew
                litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"[19]

                While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe", the
                Pentateuch
                is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I
                Samuel
                10 and the texts which follow, a curious thing happens. "One finds in the biblical text", writes Alfred
                Sendrey, "a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly
                organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical
                preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a
                school
                which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school,
                perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the
                shepherd
                boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul.[19]
