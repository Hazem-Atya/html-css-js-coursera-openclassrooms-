                    Beethoven was born in 1770 in Bonn, Germany. Both his father and grandfather were professional singers, so musicianship was in the family.

                    He started learning piano around age 4, taught by his father. He had a natural gift, and got good quickly.

                    Later on he became an assistant organist, and also played viola for the Prince-Elector's orchestra. He loved it, and thrived in the highly musical environment.

                    He moved to Vienna when he was 22 to study with the famous composer Haydn, who Beethoven thought was the greatest composer of all time.

                    Because of his enormous piano playing gifts, Beethoven was surrounded by the curious and interested Viennese social elite from early on in his career. This included most of the famous musicians of the day. Not bad!

                    Aristocrats were impressed by his talents, and supported him. He established himself as a famous piano player. But he wasn't really known for his compositions just yet!

                    In his late 20s, he started losing his hearing, and experiencing a loud ringing in his ears. Since Beethoven lived for music, his approaching deafness devastated him completely. Imagine - a divine gift and his only passion, being slowly taken away from him forever.

                    He thought seriously about suicide. After a catastrophic internal struggle, he decided it was worth it to keep going for his art. The world thanks him!

                    When he was 30, he premiered the famous Septet (Op. 20), one of his most popular pieces in his lifetime. He was now starting to become well-known and highly regarded as a composer, not just a pianist... the year was 1800.
                    This "middle period" is where Beethoven evolved as a composer, creating more heroic works depicting struggle and revolution.Napoleon Buonaparte, an influence on Beethoven's heroic and revolutionary music
                    The biggest example of this is the Third Symphony, called Eroica (Italian for "heroic"), which he dedicated to the Corsican revolutionary leader Napoleon Buonaparte.

                    Beethoven became more grumpy and irritable around this time. He started dressing scruffily and untidily, and was ruder towards other people. From here on he would care less and less about his appearance.

                    In fact he has a reputation of being a bit gruff and moody. Personally I think he didn't like conversation because of his hearing problems.

                    Some people think this is because he never managed to find a wife. But I think it's because his musical genius was flowering and he didn't have the right frame of mind to bother with useless social manners.

                    He was a stocky man. He would often stomp around Vienna (like later Viennese composer and Beethoven fanatic Johannes Brahms), deep in thought, looking like an eccentric genius. Which, I suppose, he was...

                    In 1809 various Princes and an Archduke gave Beethoven a lifetime annuity, but only if he stayed in Vienna. He readily agreed and settled there for the rest of his life. But late payments and currency devaluations make his income far from stable.

                    Beethoven wrote more symphonies (including the Fifth Symphony), string quartets, and his only opera Fidelio over the next couple of years as well.

                    He also composed some of his most well-known piano sonatas, like the Moonlight and the Waldstein.

                    We've arrived at the final part of the Beethoven biography...
                    he final years of Beethoven's life were tumultuous, the story of legends. By 1815 he was almost completely deaf, and his poor manners and personal appearance were even worse.
                    He spent a lot of his later life trying to gain custody of his nephew Karl, whose father (Beethoven's brother) died in 1815.

                    Beethoven, who wasn't very good as business or legal matters, used up a lot of his financial resources battling with Karl's mother. He eventually lost, which was a massive blow and damaged his ability to compose.

                    His music from this period is very intellectual and intense. Definitely the most famous piece from this time is his Symphony 9 (whose final movement has the "Ode to Joy").

                    He composed his last string quartets at this point, which shocked the musical world with their complex and modern sound.

                    Frédéric Chopin, French in full Frédéric François Chopin, Polish Fryderyk Franciszek Szopen, (born March 1, 1810, Żelazowa Wola, near Warsaw, Duchy of Warsaw [now in Poland] [see Researcher’s Note: Chopin’s birth date]—died October 17, 1849, Paris, France), Polish French composer and pianist of the Romantic period, best known for his solo pieces for piano and his piano concerti. Although he wrote little but piano works, many of them brief, Chopin ranks as one of music’s greatest tone poets by reason of his superfine imagination and fastidious craftsmanship.
                    Chopin’s father, Nicholas, a French émigré in Poland, was employed as a tutor to various aristocratic families, including the Skarbeks, at Żelazowa Wola, one of whose poorer relations he married. When Frédéric was eight months old, Nicholas became a French teacher at the Warsaw lyceum. Chopin himself attended the lyceum from 1823 to 1826.

                    All the family had artistic leanings, and even in infancy Chopin was always strangely moved when listening to his mother or eldest sister playing the piano. By age six he was already trying to reproduce what he heard or to make up new tunes. The following year he started piano lessons with the 61-year-old Wojciech Zywny, an all-around musician with an astute sense of values. Zywny’s simple instruction in piano playing was soon left behind by his pupil, who discovered for himself an original approach to the piano and was allowed to develop unhindered by academic rules and formal discipline.

                    00:00

                    Chopin found himself invited at an early age to play at private soirées, and at eight he made his first public appearance at a charity concert. Three years later he performed in the presence of the Russian tsar Alexander I, who was in Warsaw to open Parliament. Playing was not alone responsible for his growing reputation as a child prodigy. At seven he wrote a Polonaise in G Minor, which was printed, and soon afterward a march of his appealed to the Russian grand duke Constantine, who had it scored for his military band to play on parade. Other polonaises, mazurkas, variations, ecossaises, and a rondo followed, with the result that, when he was 16, his family enrolled him at the newly formed Warsaw Conservatory of Music. This school was directed by the Polish composer Joseph Elsner, with whom Chopin already had been studying musical theory.

                    Anton Rubinstein, in full Anton Grigoryevich Rubinstein, (born November 16 [November 28, New Style], 1829, Vykhvatinets, Podolia province, Russia—died November 8 [November 20], 1894, Peterhof), Russian composer and one of the greatest pianists of the 19th century.
                    In 1835 Rubinstein’s father opened a small factory in Moscow, and there in the same year his brother Nikolay was born. Both boys were taught piano, first by their mother and then by Aleksandr Villoing. Anton gave his first public recital in Moscow in 1839, and the following year Villoing took him abroad for a three-year concert tour. He appeared in Paris, London, the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden, attracting the attention of Chopin and Liszt. From 1844 to 1846 he and his brother studied music theory in Berlin. Anton spent two more years abroad alone, mainly in Vienna, studying the piano and composition. On his return to Russia in 1848 he settled in St. Petersburg, where in 1852 his first opera, Dmitry Donskoy, was produced; Fomka durachok (Fomka the Fool) and Sibirskiye okhotniki (The Siberian Hunters) were introduced in St. Petersburg in 1853. The years 1854 to 1958 he spent abroad.

                    Under the patronage of the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, Rubinstein in 1859 founded the Russian Music Society and later became conductor of its orchestral concerts. In 1862 he founded and became the director of the Imperial (or St. Petersburg) Conservatory, and in 1866 his brother founded the Moscow Conservatory, where Nikolay remained as director until his death in 1881. Anton Rubinstein resigned his directorship of the Imperial Conservatory in 1867 but resumed it in 1887 and continued to hold the post until 1891. From 1871 to 1872 he directed the Vienna Philharmonic concerts, and in 1872 he toured the United States.

                    Hans von Bülow, in full Hans Guido, Freiherr (baron) von Bülow, (born January 8, 1830, Dresden, Saxony [Germany]—died February 12, 1894, Cairo, Egypt), German pianist and conductor whose accurate, sensitive, and profoundly musical interpretations, especially of Richard Wagner, established him as the prototype of the virtuoso conductors who later flourished. He was also an astute and witty musical journalist.
                    As a child, Bülow studied piano under Friedrich Wieck, the father of composer and pianist Clara Schumann, and then with Franz Liszt at Weimar. Later, in Berlin, he was the principal piano teacher at the Stern and Marx conservatories and championed the works of the “New German School” of Liszt and Wagner. Beginning in the 1850s, he toured Europe, England, and the United States as a virtuoso pianist; his repertory is said to have included virtually every major work of his day. In 1857 he married Liszt’s daughter Cosima. He became director of music at the Munich court in 1864, where he conducted the premieres of two of Wagner’s works—Tristan und Isolde (1865) and Die Meistersinger (1868; The Mastersingers). Cosima left Bülow for Wagner (whom she married in 1870), but Bülow nonetheless continued to promote Wagner’s music. He conducted at Hannover from 1878 to 1880 and at Meiningen from 1880 to 1885, where his orchestra became one of the finest in Europe. Bülow was also among the earliest interpreters of Johannes Brahms, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Richard Strauss and was one of the first conductors to conduct from memory; his interpretations were noted for their integrity and emotional power.

                    He published critical editions of Ludwig van Beethoven and Johann Baptist Cramer (now superseded by later editions), piano transcriptions of Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde and other major works, and a number of compositions for orchestra. In 1893 he went to Cairo because of his failing health.

                    Sergei Rachmaninoff was a titan of early 20th century piano music, creating finger-breakingly difficult pieces and heart-meltingly dark, romantic music.

                    He was equally famous as a pianist and as a composer. I find Rachmaninoff's music sultry and passionate; most of it is very mysterious and gloomy - even old Rach himself said that he had trouble writing happy-sounding pieces!

                    His piano pieces are legendary. Rachmaninov had bizarrely large hands, which meant he could cover about 1.5 times the keyboard space a normal person could.

                    He also had an appetite for speed and a disregard for the safety of others. This scary combination means that a fair amount of his solo piano music requires superhuman skill to perform. </div>

                JOSEF HOFMANN
                (1876 - 1957)

                Both of Josef Hofmann’s parents were musicians, his mother a singer of light opera and his father a conductor of the Kraków theatre and professor of piano and harmony at the Warsaw Conservatory. Young Josef was, however, a phenomenally gifted child who learnt the basics of music at the age of three, gave his debut at the Warsaw Opera House at five, and when he played again in Warsaw at the age of seven was heard by the great Russian pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein. At Rubinstein’s urging, the German impresario Hermann Wolff wanted to manage the boy and send him on a tour of Europe. Casimir, Josef’s father, would not allow this until the boy was nine years old. This amazing child prodigy played in Germany, France, Holland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Britain. He played Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 1 Op. 15 in Berlin with the Berlin Philharmonic, and in London performed the same work with the Royal Philharmonic Society.

                The following year a tour of America was arranged for the young Hofmann. He was to play eighty concerts, performing four times a week. Wherever he played the eleven-year-old boy caused a sensation with his playing and improvising. After three months of performances which included fifty recitals, seventeen of which were at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children stepped in citing the boy’s fragile health. Josef had been offered $10,000 for the American tour, but a benefactor offered Casimir $50,000 on the condition that Josef would not appear in public until he was eighteen years of age. The rest of the tour was cancelled and the family returned to Germany.

                In Berlin, Hofmann took some lessons from pianist and composer Moritz Moszkowski who realised however that he could teach Hofmann very little.It was in 1892, when Hofmann was sixteen, that he became a private pupil of Anton Rubinstein who had himself been an exploited child prodigy and was by then the greatest living pianist. Once a week in winter, and twice a week in summer, Hofmann travelled from Berlin to Dresden to study with Rubinstein. During this two-year period he had around forty lessons with the great master, later describing the relationship he formed with Rubinstein as ‘the most important event of my life’.

                    Frédéric Chopin, French in full Frédéric François Chopin, Polish Fryderyk Franciszek Szopen, (born March 1, 1810, Żelazowa Wola, near Warsaw, Duchy of Warsaw [now in Poland] [see Researcher’s Note: Chopin’s birth date]—died October 17, 1849, Paris, France), Polish French composer and pianist of the Romantic period, best known for his solo pieces for piano and his piano concerti. Although he wrote little but piano works, many of them brief, Chopin ranks as one of music’s greatest tone poets by reason of his superfine imagination and fastidious craftsmanship.
                    Chopin’s father, Nicholas, a French émigré in Poland, was employed as a tutor to various aristocratic families, including the Skarbeks, at Żelazowa Wola, one of whose poorer relations he married. When Frédéric was eight months old, Nicholas became a French teacher at the Warsaw lyceum. Chopin himself attended the lyceum from 1823 to 1826.

                    All the family had artistic leanings, and even in infancy Chopin was always strangely moved when listening to his mother or eldest sister playing the piano. By age six he was already trying to reproduce what he heard or to make up new tunes. The following year he started piano lessons with the 61-year-old Wojciech Zywny, an all-around musician with an astute sense of values. Zywny’s simple instruction in piano playing was soon left behind by his pupil, who discovered for himself an original approach to the piano and was allowed to develop unhindered by academic rules and formal discipline.

                    00:00

                    Chopin found himself invited at an early age to play at private soirées, and at eight he made his first public appearance at a charity concert. Three years later he performed in the presence of the Russian tsar Alexander I, who was in Warsaw to open Parliament. Playing was not alone responsible for his growing reputation as a child prodigy. At seven he wrote a Polonaise in G Minor, which was printed, and soon afterward a march of his appealed to the Russian grand duke Constantine, who had it scored for his military band to play on parade. Other polonaises, mazurkas, variations, ecossaises, and a rondo followed, with the result that, when he was 16, his family enrolled him at the newly formed Warsaw Conservatory of Music. This school was directed by the Polish composer Joseph Elsner, with whom Chopin already had been studying musical theory.

                    Claudio Arrau, one of the great pianists of the 20th century, died yesterday in Murzzuschlag, Austria. He was 88 years old and lived in Munich.

                    Friede F. Rothe, Mr. Arrau's personal representative, said the Chilean-born pianist died after after emergency surgery to correct an intestinal blockage on Saturday.

                    Mr. Arrau was in Austria for what was to have been his first performance in two years, a private recital to open a museum in Murzzuschlag, 60 miles south of Vienna. He had stopped performing in June 1989 after the death of his wife, Ruth Schneider, a German-born mezzo-soprano, whom he married in 1937. In addition to his scheduled concert in Austria, he was to have peformed a recital on Friday at the Schumann Festival in Dusseldorf, Germany, at which the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau was to have given him the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society of London.

                    The Chilean Government designated today a national day of mourning for Mr. Arrau. A Model of Clarity </div>
